abstract = {QMCPACK is an open source quantum Monte Carlo package for ab initio electronic structure calculations. It supports calculations of metallic and insulating solids, molecules, atoms, and some model Hamiltonians. Implemented real space quantum Monte Carlo algorithms include variational, diffusion, and reptation Monte Carlo. QMCPACK uses Slater–Jastrow type trial wavefunctions in conjunction with a sophisticated optimizer capable of optimizing tens of thousands of parameters. The orbital space auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method is also implemented, enabling cross validation between different highly accurate methods. The code is specifically optimized for calculations with large numbers of electrons on the latest high performance computing architectures, including multicore central processing unit and graphical processing unit systems. We detail the program’s capabilities, outline its structure, and give examples of its use in current research calculations. The package is available at http://qmcpack.org.}

Such aspects have been implemented in the QMC=Chem code developed at Toulouse (France). First, a simple, general, and fault-tolerant simulation environment adapted to QMC algorithms is presented. Second, we present a study of the parallel efficiency of the QMC=Chem code on the Curie machine (TGCC-GENCI, CEA France) showing that a very good scalability can be maintained up to 80 000 cores. Third, it is shown that a great enhancement in performance with the single-core optimization tools developed at Versailles (France) can be obtained.},

    abstract = "{Variational quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) is an ab initio method for solving the electronic Schrödinger equation that is exact in principle, but limited by the flexibility of the available Ansätze in practice. The recently introduced deep QMC approach, specifically two deep-neural-network Ansätze PauliNet and FermiNet, allows variational QMC to reach the accuracy of diffusion QMC, but little is understood about the convergence behavior of such Ansätze. Here, we analyze how deep variational QMC approaches the fixed-node limit with increasing network size. First, we demonstrate that a deep neural network can overcome the limitations of a small basis set and reach the mean-field (MF) complete-basis-set limit. Moving to electron correlation, we then perform an extensive hyperparameter scan of a deep Jastrow factor for LiH and H4 and find that variational energies at the fixed-node limit can be obtained with a sufficiently large network. Finally, we benchmark MF and many-body Ansätze on H2O, increasing the fraction of recovered fixed-node correlation energy of single-determinant Slater–Jastrow-type Ansätze by half an order of magnitude compared to previous variational QMC results, and demonstrate that a single-determinant Slater–Jastrow-backflow version of the Ansatz overcomes the fixed-node limitations. This analysis helps understand the superb accuracy of deep variational Ansätze in comparison to the traditional trial wavefunctions at the respective level of theory and will guide future improvements of the neural-network architectures in deep QMC.}",

Whereas for simple model systems the whole many-body wave function can be represented by a neural network, the antisymmetry condition of non-trivial fermionic systems is incorporated by means of a Slater determinant. To demonstrate the accuracy of the trial wave functions, an exactly solvable model system of two trapped interacting particles, as well as the hydrogen dimer, is studied.},

The Pauli exclusion principle is dealt with explicitly to ensure that the trial wave-functions are physical. The optimal trial wave-function is obtained through variational Monte Carlo and the computational cost scales quadratically with the number of electrons. The algorithm does not make use of any prior knowledge such as atomic orbitals. Yet it is able to represent accurately the ground-states of the tested systems, including He, H2, Be, B, LiH, and a chain of 10 hydrogen atoms. This opens up new possibilities for solving large-scale many-electron Schrödinger equation.}

Despite a great deal of general methodological developments, representing fermionic matter is however still early research activity. Here we present an extension of neural-network quantum states to model interacting fermionic problems. Borrowing techniques from quantum simulation, we directly map fermionic degrees of freedom to spin ones, and then use neural-network quantum states to perform electronic structure calculations. For several diatomic molecules in a minimal basis set, we benchmark our approach against widely used coupled cluster methods, as well as many-body variational states. On some test molecules, we systematically improve upon coupled cluster methods and Jastrow wave functions, reaching chemical accuracy or better. Finally, we discuss routes for future developments and improvements of the methods presented.},
