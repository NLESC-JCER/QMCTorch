abstract = {QMCPACK is an open source quantum Monte Carlo package for ab initio electronic structure calculations. It supports calculations of metallic and insulating solids, molecules, atoms, and some model Hamiltonians. Implemented real space quantum Monte Carlo algorithms include variational, diffusion, and reptation Monte Carlo. QMCPACK uses Slater–Jastrow type trial wavefunctions in conjunction with a sophisticated optimizer capable of optimizing tens of thousands of parameters. The orbital space auxiliary-field quantum Monte Carlo method is also implemented, enabling cross validation between different highly accurate methods. The code is specifically optimized for calculations with large numbers of electrons on the latest high performance computing architectures, including multicore central processing unit and graphical processing unit systems. We detail the program’s capabilities, outline its structure, and give examples of its use in current research calculations. The package is available at http://qmcpack.org.}

abstract={In this work we discuss several key aspects for an efficient implementation and deployment of large-scale quantum Monte Carlo (QMC) simulations for chemical applications on petaflops infrastructures. Such aspects have been implemented in the QMC=Chem code developed at Toulouse (France). First, a simple, general, and fault-tolerant simulation environment adapted to QMC algorithms is presented. Second, we present a study of the parallel efficiency of the QMC=Chem code on the Curie machine (TGCC-GENCI, CEA France) showing that a very good scalability can be maintained up to 80 000 cores. Third, it is shown that a great enhancement in performance with the single-core optimization tools developed at Versailles (France) can be obtained.},
